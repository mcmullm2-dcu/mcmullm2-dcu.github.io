Welcome to my new blog!

For a general introduction to who I am and what I do, please visit the
[About Me](/about) page.

As for this blog, well it's difficult to settle on a theme for a new blog. I've
got a few exams coming up next month, so I guess the first few posts will be
revising material from DCU's Software Development course. After that (or
possibly alongside that) I hope to put up some portfolio pieces, exercises,
and any coding-related material I find interesting. I hope you do too!
