<p>Sometimes, optimising code for performance seems unneccessary. Have you ever
    thrown together a utility to process thousands of files with the intention
    of leaving it to run overnight? I've written a few of these over the years,
    and generally they're just throwaway programs to do a bit of gruntwork as
    part of a larger project. Occassionally though, they take longer than
    expected.</p>

<p>A few years ago, we were developing a ‘print-on-demand’ portal for a large
    national retailer, and needed thousands of thumbnail images of greeting
    cards. These featured different colours, backgrounds and photographs to suit
    a wide range of categories. Here are a few examples:</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-4">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/pod/cardsample1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Sample of a birthday card for a young boy" class="img-fluid">
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-4">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/pod/cardsample2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Sample of a fathers's day card" class="img-fluid">
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-4">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/pod/cardsample3.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Sample of a birthday card for a teenage girl" class="img-fluid">
    </div>
</div>

<p>Our small team couldn’t possibly create the thousands of themes that
    established vendors were offering, and the platform we had to work with made
    it unfeasable to integrate with licensed content. So we decided to cheat a
    little.</p>

<p>For each size card we offered, we created a small number of blank templates:
    1 photo, 1 photo with text, 2 photos with text, and so on. Then we intended
    to create a bunch of thumbnail images for different occasions (birthday,
    wedding, etc), and point them all to the same template. Here’s an example of
    a template consisting of one photo with text underneath, reused in a few
    different categories:</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/pod/greetingcardtemplate.jpg' | relative_url }}"
            alt="Sample of several greeting card thumbnails pointing to a single template" class="img-fluid">
    </div>
</div>

<p>From the end-user’s perspective, there was an illusion of choice, but
    effectively they were all ordering the same product. It was a good way of
    measuring which categories were popular, which in turn would allow us to
    prioritise where to add unique templates over time.</p>
    
<p>Although there was a little bit of setting up, it was manageable. I created a
    folder for each category, and added a few examples of suitable stock
    photography into each one. Next, I created a console app in C#, which
    defined a few colour palettes, text, etc., then roughly followed this
    pattern:</p>

{% highlight c# %}
foreach(template in templates)
{
  foreach(category in categories)
  {
    foreach(palette in palettes)
    {
      // photoCombosRemaining is true for as long as each folder of photos can
      // still create a unique set of images to load into each template.
      while(photoCombosRemaining)
      {
        loadUniquePhotoCombo();
        generateThumbnail();
      }
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I left it running overnight as a test, and it quickly became apparent that
    optimisation was going to be more important than I initially thought. For a
    start, every unique combination of photographs and colour palettes grew to
    an unmanageable number, which would have taken weeks or months to get
    through. Secondly, it was obvious from the initial batch that a large
    percentage of thumbnails would be unusable, mainly due to landscape photos
    being placed into portrait placeholders (and vice versa). Editing such a
    large number would be completely unfeasible.</p>

<h2>Understanding the problem</h2>
<p>Before optimising anything, it helps to understand what’s going on. What
    we’re dealing with in the outer loop is defining how many spaces are
    available in a template for photographs to be placed. Let’s call that k.</p>

<p>The innermost loop, which chooses photos to place inside each slot, defines
    how many photos we have to choose from. We’ll call this number n.</p>
    
<p>So we have a template with k slots to add photos to, and then a larger number
    of photos (n) to choose from to fill those slots. Each selection is unique,
    but the order of each selection matters. It is a problem in mathematics
    known as k-permutations.</p>
    
<p>The number of permutations can be calculated easily enough. The first item
    can be chosen from all n items. Next, choose from the remaining (n-1) items,
    and so on, until all k slots are filled (n-k+1):</p>


    $$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$

Woohoo!
