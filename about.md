Hi! My name is Michael McMullin, and I'm starting this blog to share some coding
related thoughts and projects I've worked on.

My programming journey started in the early 1980's on a borrowed
[Sinclair ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81), and these days I write
software for Ireland's largest digital print provider to help automate and
streamline production. I've also gone [back to college](https://www.dcu.ie/) to
learn more about software development. My original degree is in Visual
Communications.

So I hope you find something of interest in here. Thanks for visiting!
