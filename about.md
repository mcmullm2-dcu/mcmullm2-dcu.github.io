Hi! My name is Michael McMullin, a software and web developer with experience in
systems automation, consultancy and analysis. I currently work for
[McGowans](https://www.mcgowansprint.com){:target="_blank"}, Ireland's leading
digital print provider, where I've helped to more than double the capacity of
jobs processed by the prepress department. As well as creating a whole bunch of
utilities to help with day to day tasks, major projects include:

* Design & development of a print-on-demand portal for a major nationwide
retailer, along with a full internal order-tracking system that interacted with
the main company MIS.
* Unified disparate company systems under a single custom API.
* Improved the processing of a leading foodservices twice-weekly point-of-sale
orders from 1.5 days to 45 minutes (approximately 1,600% improvement!) through
careful analysis and automation of the main bottlenecks.

My programming journey started in the early 1980's on a borrowed
[Sinclair ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81){:target="_blank"}, and these
days I write software using a variety of tools and languages.

I've also gone [back to college](https://www.dcu.ie/){:target="_blank"} to
learn more about software development. My original degree is in Visual
Communications.

So I hope you find something of interest in here. Thanks for visiting!
